# Telegram-Media-Downloader

An extension for the Chrome browser that lets users download media from the Telegram messenger's groups, chats and channels.
Downloads pictures, videos, voice messages, stickers and other files.

NOTES:
- The farther back in time the media are situated in a big chat, the more time it will take to download them. 
- The browser might crash if you try downloading ALL the media at once in a big chat.
- If you get the 'Too many requests' Error, reload the page and try again. In most cases it solves the problem.
